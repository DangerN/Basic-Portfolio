    Hello! I'm just a 22 year old Madisonian foodie who loves to explore different cultures through their dishes.
    In my free time, I like to play videogames on my PS4 or Nintendo Switch, embroider, meditate, go on hikes, take care of my plant babies, shopping and just having a good time with good company!
    I am currently a graphic designer/pre-flight specialist for the Department of Admin - Publishing and Distribution Center. 
    Graphic designing has been a catalyst for my interest in coding. I found that I enjoy not only the designing aspect of CSS,
    but also highly interested in the magic behind completing a webpage using HTML and JavaScript.
